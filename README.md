# Final Fantasy VIII Triple Triad AI

This program will autonomously play a game of Triple Triad within Final Fantasy VIII (Steam edition, Windows). Game state is read from screenshots and the game is controlled by emulating keystrokes. Best moves are determined by a full depth alpha-beta minimax search that maximizes the card difference. All rule combinations that contain the Open rule are supported, and **the AI is guaranteed to win the game if it is possible**.
